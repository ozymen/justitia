<h1>Submitting programs</h1>

<h2>How do I submit a program?</h2>

To submit a program you wrote for an assignment:
<ul>
 <li>Navigate to the assignment.
 <li>Select the file in the "submit" box.
 <li>Click on "submit".
</ul>

<h2>Programs with multiple files</h2>

For some assignments you will create more than one source file.
All files should be submited to justitia.

<p>
You can also bundle multiple files and directories in a ZIP archive, and submit that instead.


<h2>How are programs judged?</h2>

Justitia judges submitted programs by compiling them, and then executing them with a predefined testset.

<p>
After a submitted program has been judged by Justitia, you will get feedback.
The amount of feedback depends on the settings by the course administator.

<p>
The possible status codes are:
<table>
 <tr><th>Pending
     <td>The submission has been received, but is not yet being judged.
         
 <tr><th>Judging
     <td>The submission is currently being compiled or run.
     
 <tr><th>Passed
     <td>The answer is correct.
     
 <tr><th>Failed: unknown language
     <td>There are no source files in the submission, at least not in a language that Justitia understands.
     
 <tr><th>Failed: compile error
     <td>Your submission failed to compile.
         The compiler error message will be available if you click on the "view error message" link.
     
 <tr><th>Failed: runtime error
     <td>There was a runtime error when the program was executed, for example "out of mememory", "division by zero" or "NullPointerException".
     
 <tr><th>Failed: wrong answer
     <td>Your answer did not match that of the reference implementation.
     
</table>
