    <h3>CourseStore</h3>
      <p>
        Files: <tt>BASE/courses</tt>
        Assignments are stored in a directory hierarchy.
        Each directory can contain an "<tt>info</tt>" file, a simple key/value listing of attributes for that directory.
        Attributes are inherited by child directories.
      <pre>
        title: My Course Part
        start: 2009-09-01
        end:   2010-01-01
        language: java
      </pre>
      <p>
        Attributes with name "<tt>child <i>attr</i></tt>" are only applied to children.
      <p>
        $program makes no distinction between assignments, courses, weeks, etc..
        Each is stored as a directory.
        
    <h3>Frontend</h3>
      <p>
        Files: <tt>BASE/frontend</tt>
        The frontend consists of a webserver that serves information to students and administrators.
        The frontend is written in PHP and communicates with a database and the CourseStore.
        Submissions are made to the frontend.
        
    <h3>Backend</h3>
      <p>
        Files: <tt>BASE/backend</tt>
        The backends are responsible for judging submissions.
        It is a deamon shellscript that continually asks the webserver for new submissions over HTTP.
        Multiple backends can be running at the same time.
