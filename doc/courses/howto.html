<h1>How do I...</h1>

<dl>
 <dt>Q: Some submissions fail to judge correctly, I don't know what happens.
 <dd>You can manually compile and judge submissions from the command line.<p>
     <ul>
      <li>Log in to the justitia server.
      <li>Go to the <tt>backend</tt> directory.
      <li>Execute <tt>./try_to_judge_single_submission <em>&lt;submissionid&gt;</em></tt>.
     </ul>
     This judges the submission with all debug outputs on, and doesn't delete temporary files.<br>
     These temporary files will contain the output of the compiler and runner.
