<h1>Judge daemons</h1>

The judge daemon is located in <tt>JUSTITIA_DIR/backend</tt>.
There are several scripts to run judges:

<dl>
 <dt><tt>judge_once</tt>
 <dd>Starts a judge daemon.
     The daemon sits in a loop, polling for new submissions. When a new submission arrives the daemon will judge it.
     <br>
     When the judge daemon exits (either because of a crash or because of a graceful exit), the script ends.
 
 <dt><tt>judge_forever</tt>
 <dd>Starts a judge daemon. When the daemon exits it is restarted, unless a stop is requested from the web interface.
 
 <dt><tt>try_to_judge_single_submission</tt>
 <dd>Judge a single submission, this is useful for debugging.
 
 <dt><tt>judge_daemon.php</tt>
 <dd>This is the actual judge daemon, writen in PHP. You should never call it directly.
</dl>
